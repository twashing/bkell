## Abstract

_**Bkell**_ provides a Shell and API for maintaining balanced records for business transactions. It employs double-entry bookkeeping, where every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. For instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit entry of $100 to an account called "Cash" and a credit entry to an account called "Income."

For a more detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping concepts, refer to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system).
