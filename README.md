## Abstract

_Bkell_ provides a Shell and API for maintaining balanced records for business transactions. It employs double-entry bookkeeping, where every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. For instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit entry of $100 to an account called "Cash" and a credit entry to an account called "Income."

For a more detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping concepts, refer to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system).

## Architecture 

The user works in a shell environment, manipulating the core data structures of the system. Bkell uses Clojure for its runtime, and Datomic as its datastore. The system comprises, mostly of simple functions, and a data abstraction layer to push and pull data, in and out of the database.

### Data Structure

These are the core entities in the system. The main business transaction are adding and manipulating entries, against a given set of accounts. All those business operations happen within a Journal, of a Book, for a given Group, which has Users attached. 

  - **Group**
    - can only have 1 owner 
    - can have many users
    - can have many books 

  - **User**
    - belongs to at least 1 group 
    - can belong to many groups 
    - must own at least one group 
    - cannot update fields of another user

  - **Book**
    - 1 book can have many accounts 
    - 1 book should have only 1 journal 
    - only a group's users (incl. owner) can CRUD this data

  - **Journal**
    - each journal can have many entries 
    - only a group's users (incl. owner) can CRUD this data

  - **Account**
    - no duplicates
    - only a group's users (incl. owner) can CRUD this data

  - **Entry**
    - each entry must be balanced 
    - query within date ranges
    - only a group's users (incl. owner) can CRUD this data

## Todo List

- setup test infrastructure (using test.check)
- establish core data structure (datomic schema)
- datomic wrapper (using adi), with nominal CRUD operations; the abouve data structure constraints must be maintained when manipulating entites in the system.
